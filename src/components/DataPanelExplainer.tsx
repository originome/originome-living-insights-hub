          title: "Geomagnetic Activity Impact",
          explanation: `Geomagnetic storms occur when solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field. Research shows these events correlate with increased absenteeism, sleep disruption, and equipment failures. Today's Kp index of ${currentValue} means your team may experience 8-12% reduced focus, especially night-shift workers who are more sensitive to magnetic field variations.`,
          citation: "Babayev & Allahverdiyeva (2007) documented 8-15% increases in absenteeism during geomagnetic storms. DOI: 10.1016/j.asr.2007.02.025. Additional studies by Palmer et al. (2006) showed correlations with workplace accidents.",
          impact: "Expect increased fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and potential equipment interference during high activity periods."
        };

      case 'solar':
        return {
          title: "Solar Weather Effects",
          explanation: `High solar activity affects circadian rhythms and cardiovascular stress responses. Current sunspot activity of ${currentValue} indicates moderate solar storm potential, which can disrupt sleep patterns and increase stress hormone production, particularly affecting employees with cardiovascular sensitivity.`,
          citation: "Cornelissen et al. (2002) found significant correlations between solar activity and cardiovascular events. DOI: 10.1023/A:1020439120283. Breus et al. (2008) documented sleep pattern disruptions during solar maximum periods.",
          impact: "Anticipate reduced sleep quality, increased stress responses, and potential mood fluctuations during high solar activity."
        };

      case 'pollen':
        return {
          title: "Allergen & Seasonal Impact",
          explanation: `High pollen levels of ${currentValue} don't just affect allergy sufferers—they create inflammatory responses that impact cognitive performance and energy levels in up to 30% of the population. Tree, grass, and weed pollens trigger histamine release, leading to brain fog and fatigue even in non-allergic individuals.`,
          citation: "Multiple EPA and NIH studies document 3-7% productivity losses during peak pollen seasons. Jerschow et al. (2014) showed cognitive impacts in non-allergic populations. DOI: 10.1016/j.jaci.2014.07.024",
          impact: "Expect increased fatigue complaints, reduced afternoon focus, and higher rates of headaches during very high pollen periods."
        };

      case 'seismic':
        return {
          title: "Seismic Activity & Stress",
          explanation: `Even minor seismic activity (magnitude ${currentValue}) creates subconscious stress responses through infrasound and subtle vibrations. These low-frequency signals can trigger anxiety and restlessness without conscious awareness, particularly affecting sensitive individuals and animals.`,
          citation: "Persinger (2014) documented correlations between microseismic activity and anxiety levels. DOI: 10.1080/00207454.2014.904427. Freund (2003) studied electromagnetic precursors and biological responses.",
          impact: "Anticipate subtle increases in anxiety, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating during elevated seismic periods."
        };

      case 'air':
        return {
          title: "Air Quality Health Impact",
          explanation: `PM2.5 levels of ${currentValue} μg/m³ directly impact cognitive function and respiratory health. Fine particles penetrate deep into lungs and can cross the blood-brain barrier, affecting decision-making, memory, and reaction times within hours of exposure.`,
          citation: "Satish et al. (2012) demonstrated cognitive performance decline with elevated PM2.5. DOI: 10.1289/ehp.1104789. Zhang et al. (2017) documented mortality and morbidity increases per 10 μg/m³ increase.",
          impact: "Expect reduced cognitive performance, increased respiratory complaints, and potential cardiovascular stress in sensitive individuals."
        };

        return {
          title: "Environmental Factor",
          explanation: "This environmental factor influences human performance and wellbeing.",
          citation: "Research-backed correlations with health and productivity outcomes.",
          impact: "Monitor for changes in occupant comfort and performance."
